## Introduction

This repository contains the code and documentation for the Bachelor's Degree Final Project (Catalan: *Treball de Final de Grau*; TFG) in Computer Engineering at the Autonomous University of Barcelona (Official name in Catalan: *Universitat Aut√≤noma de Barcelona*; UAB) titled *Quantum Graph Neural Network for solving TSP*. This project explores the exciting intersection of quantum computing and machine learning to tackle the so called Travelling Salesperson Problem (TSP).

## Prerequisites

Before you can run the code in this repository, you will need the following prerequisites:

- Basic understanding of quantum computing and machine learning.
- Python 3.8 or higher (lower versions may also work well, but we will not support them).
- Access to a quantum computing platform or simulator (e.g., IBM Qiskit, Google Cirq).
- Required Python libraries, which can be installed using `pip`:
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Project Structure

The project is organized as follows:

- `data/`: This directory contains the image datasets used for training and testing.
- `docs/`: Project documentation and presentation files.
- `imgs/`: Project images and plots.
- `models/`: Implementations of quantum models.
- `notebooks/`: Jupyter notebooks demonstrating the experiments and results.
- `utils/`: Utility functions and helper scripts.
- `.gitignore`: Github .gitignore file to get rid of annoying files.
- `LICENSE.txt`: The project's license file.
- `requirements.txt`: The Python requirements text file.
- `README.md`: This documentation file.

## Usage

To replicate the experiments or use the implemented models, follow these steps:

1. Clone this repository to your local machine:
```
git clone https://github.com/yeray142/QML-QGNN.git
```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
```
cd <directory_where_the_cloned_repository_is_located>
```
3. Open the Jupyter notebooks in the `notebooks/` directory to explore the experiments and results.

4. Use the code and models in the `models/` directory for your image classification tasks.
